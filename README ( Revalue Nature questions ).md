# QGIS
Last GIS work I have done. Final project for the minor in Innovation for agribusiness


Although I have no direct experience working with GIS tools in a professional environment, I am excited to capitalize on my technology background and ongoing studies in environmental engineering and data science to excel in the GIS analyst position at Revalue Nature. My academic background has fostered a strong quantitative skill set and a drive to make a tangible impact, in line with the mission-driven ethos of the organization. In addition, my adaptability and commitment to continuous learning, evidenced by my recent academic pursuits and willingness to embrace new challenges, position me as a proactive and autonomous candidate capable of thriving in a remote work environment. I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to the innovative and impactful work of Revalue Nature's global team and am eager to further develop my skills in GIS and spatial data analysis to support nature-based solutions on a planetary scale.


My main motivations for working in the nature-based carbon projects sector come from a deep-seated desire to have a real and tangible impact on the environment. Combining my personal interests with my passion for nature, I am drawn to the opportunity to contribute to global projects that address environmental challenges. I am motivated by the prospect of using my knowledge to support initiatives that not only protect and regenerate nature, but also have a significant impact on mitigating climate change and promoting sustainability on a global scale.
